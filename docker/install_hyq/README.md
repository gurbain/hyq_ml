# Installation tools

Install the DLS framework, Xenomai 3 and other goodies.

## How to use:

To start the program open a terminal and type:

```bash
./install.sh
```

This will open a fancy graphic interface.

Important note: To install the DLS Framework, first setup the ssh keys, install the dependencies and ROS.
Xenomai and the ecat layer are needed only on the real robot!
